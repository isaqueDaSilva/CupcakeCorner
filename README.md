# Cupcake Corner
The easy way to make your cupcake request in any Apple Platforms.
 
 # Overview
The Cupcake Corner is a Cross Platform app that enhance the user experience when those are getting out cupcakes in our store and also our employes want to manager the sales in the Admin version.<br>

When the user opens, for the first time the app, the fist thing that they will see is the Buy View, displaying in a grid style, a list of all cupcakes' flavors avaiable to buy. In client side, is also displayed, at the top of cupcakes' list a highlight of the newest cupcake created in our database.<br>

Clicking on any cupcake available in the list, the user will be taken to a new screen. In client's side, the screen is the Order View, the place where users can be making their orders request. The page brings together all informations necessary for user, like ingredients used and pricing of the current cupcake, also in this page, has two buttons, that is used for user says if it has frosting and sprinkles. Those buttons, also enhance the user experience in this view, because when the price is increased or decreased, activating or deactivating the request, there is new SwiftUI's `.contentTransition()` modifier being used with `numericText(value:)` for creates cool transitions when the value changes. On admin side, the screen that the admin will be taken is the Cupcake Detail, and in this view it is possible to control all of the chosen cupcake like, edit, checking something or even delete it.<br>

Moving to the second tab, we have the bag view, and this view is responsible for displaying all orders. In client side, the user can only observe the status of your order, which is updated by an Admin on Admin Side. Those updates occur in real-time with no delay, thanks by WebSocket, that enables a bidirectional channel between Client-Side(App) and Server. Because this when the user makes a new order, a request is sent to the server, that process and save on database, the user receives a response when the process is finished with success, and the admin receives on your channel an database's update, informing that a new order made. When its ready to be sent, the admin sending an update for the server can be updating an order saved in database, and finally, with this changes, the user will be get an update informing changes. Same process when the order will be delivered.<br>

Finaly, we have the Account View, and in this View your focus into managing user's account, offering a possibility to update the account, making logout or even delete the account. Also, in this view is possible to visualizy a panel with a panorama of the purchases(Client Side) and ballance of all cupcake's sales(Admin Side) with the avarge of sales or purchases, enabling user to visualizy how is your numbers. The Chart is buit using Swift Chat.<br>

Even there, to access all functionality of the app, is required an user account. The client account is created by user itself, but the admin, only other admin can create a new account. After the account creation, the user needs to authenticate on the system to get a token value that is stored in the System's Keychain, also this tokens is requested to realize all things that depends a communication with the server.
